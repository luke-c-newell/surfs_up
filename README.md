## Overview
My client, Mr Avy, is looking to invest in a Surfing and Ice Cream store based on the island of Oahu, Hawaii. Mr Avy would like to understand the weather patterns on the island, in order to determine whether the investment is going to be fruitful. Using weather data from an SQLite database, I have created a program to extract the data into Pandas DataFrames and perform a statistical analysis on both the temperature and rainfall measurements.
